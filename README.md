# HTML-basics-delete-text
Delete text doesnt mean just backspacing and erasing, delete basically just scratches the word out, but you can see it was scratched out. It basically puts a solid line right through the word, giving it that scratched out look. To do so you use the key &lt;del> put the text u want scratched out and close.
